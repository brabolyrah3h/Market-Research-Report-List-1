<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lipid-regulating Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Statins</li><li>Non-statins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lipid-regulating drugs market is primarily divided into two categories: statins and non-statins. Statins, such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver, effectively lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. Non-statins include various agents like fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids, which address lipid levels through alternative mechanisms, such as enhancing fat metabolism or reducing triglycerides. Both categories are essential in managing dyslipidemia and preventing cardiovascular diseases, catering to diverse patient needs.</p></p>
