<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Traditional CTG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Cardiotocography</li><li>Internal Cardiotocography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Traditional CTG (cardiotocography) is classified into two main market types: external and internal cardiotocography. External CTG involves placing sensors on the mother's abdomen to non-invasively monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions, making it widely used during labor. Internal CTG, on the other hand, requires a small electrode inserted through the cervix to attach directly to the fetusâ€™s scalp, providing more accurate readings but requiring more invasive procedures. Both types are essential for assessing fetal well-being during pregnancy and labor.</p></p>
